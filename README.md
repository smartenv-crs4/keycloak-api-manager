# 🔐 Keycloak Adapter API for Node.js (Express)
Keycloak-api-manager is a comprehensive **Node.js library** that wraps the official 
Keycloak Admin REST API, providing a clean and consistent functional interface for 
programmatic management of Keycloak resources.  With this package, you can easily interact with Keycloak just like through its Admin 
Console — creating and managing realms, clients, users, roles, groups, 
permissions, and authentication policies — all via simple JavaScript functions.
The library simplifies integration of Keycloak into custom applications, automation 
scripts, and backend services by handling authentication, 
API calls, and error management internally. Designed for developers who want full control over Keycloak’s administrative capabilities 
without manually invoking REST endpoints, keycloak-api-manager enables fast, reliable, 
and type-safe operations across multiple realms and environments.
it is a wrapper based on '@keycloak/keycloak-admin-client'

## 🧩 Configuration

In your Express application:

```js
import keycloakAdapter from 'keycloak-api-manager';

// Configure and Initialize Keycloak adapter
keycloackAdapter.configure(app,{
        "realm": "Realm-Project",
        "auth-server-url": "https://YourKeycloakUrl:30040/",
        "ssl-required": "external",
        "resource": "keycloackclientName",
        "credentials": {
            "secret": "aaaaaaaaaa"
        },
        "confidential-port": 0
    },
    {
        session:{
            secret: 'mySecretForSession',
        }
    })
```

keycloackAdapter.configure is a configuration function for the Keycloak 
adapter in an Express application.  
It must be called at app startup, before defining any protected routes.
It is an async function and returns a promise

Parameters:
- app: Express application instance (e.g., const app = express();)
-   keyCloakConfig: JSON object containing the Keycloak client configuration.
     This can be obtained from the Keycloak admin console:
     Clients → [client name] → Installation → "Keycloak OIDC JSON" → Download
      Example:
    {
    "realm": "realm-name",
    "auth-server-url": "https://keycloak.example.com/",
    "ssl-required": "external",
    "resource": "client-name",
    "credentials": { "secret": "secret-code" },
    "confidential-port": 0
    }
- keyCloakOptions: advanced configuration options for the adapter.
  Main supported options:
    - session: Express session configuration (as in express-session)
    - scope: authentication scopes (e.g., 'openid profile email offline_access')
      Note: to use offline_access, the client must have the option enabled and
      the user must have the offline_access role.
    - idpHint: to suggest an identity provider to Keycloak during login
    - cookies: to enable cookie handling
    - realmUrl: to override the realm URL
- adminClientCredentials: [Optional] Advanced configuration for setting up the realm-admin user or client,
  which will be used as the administrator to manage Keycloak via API.
  This is required in order to use the administrative functions exposed by this library.
  If this parameter is not provided, it will not be possible to use the administrative functions of Keycloak
  exposed by this adapter. In fact, exports.kcAdminClient will be null, so any attempt to call
  keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient will result in a runtime error due to access on an undefined object
  Main supported options:
    - realmName: [Optional] A String that specifies the realm to authenticate against, if different from the "keyCloakConfig.realm" parameter.
      If you intend to use Keycloak administrator credentials, this should be set to 'master'.
    - scope: [Optional] A string that specifies The OAuth2 scope requested during authentication (optional).
      Typically, not required for administrative clients. example:openid profile
    - requestOptions: [Optional] JSON parameters to configure HTTP requests (such as custom headers, timeouts, etc.).
      It is compatible with the Fetch API standard. Fetch request options
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#options
    - username: [Optional] string username. Required when using the password grant type.
    - password: [Optional] string password. Required when using the password grant type.
    - grantType: The OAuth2 grant type used for authentication.
      Possible values: 'password', 'client_credentials', 'refresh_token', etc.
    - clientId: string containing the client ID configured in Keycloak. Required for all grant types.
    - clientSecret: [Optional] string containing the client secret of the client. Required for client_credentials or confidential clients.
    - totp: string for Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for multifactor authentication (MFA), if enabled for the user.
    - offlineToken: [Optional] boolean value. If true, requests an offline token (used for long-lived refresh tokens). Default is false.
    - refreshToken: [Optional] string containing a valid refresh token to request a new access token when using the refresh_token grant type.

## 🔧 Available Middlewares

### `underKeycloakProtection(callback) - deprecated - ` 
@deprecated. Use the `configure` Method with `await keycloakAdapter.configure(...)`,
then define your resources as you normally would in Express:
```js
    await keycloakAdapter.configure(config_Parameters);
    
    // all your routes

    app.get('/my-route', handler);
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to define your resources inside a container after configuration,
you can use the `then` syntax:
```js
    keycloakAdapter.configure(configParameters).then(() => {
        // Define all your routes here
        app.get('/my-route', handler);
    });
```

This Method is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.

Method to define Express routes that must be protected by Keycloak.

This method must be called **after** Keycloak has been configured with `configure()`.
The routes declared inside the provided callback will be protected and will have access
to authentication/authorization features managed by Keycloak.

📌 Public (unprotected) routes should be declared **before** calling this method.

@param {Function} callback - A function that defines all routes to be protected.
It must contain exclusively routes requiring authentication.

✅ Usage example:
```js
// Public route not protected by Keycloak
app.get('/public', (req, res) => {
res.send('Public content');
});

// Section of routes protected by Keycloak
keycloakAdapter.underKeycloakProtection(() => {

    // This function is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. 
    // It is retained only for backward compatibility with older versions
    
    // Route protected by authentication
    app.get('/confidential', keycloakAdapter.protectMiddleware(), (req, res) => {
        res.send('Confidential content visible only to authenticated users');
    });

    // Route with forced login: handled directly by middleware
    app.get('/loginMiddleware', keycloakAdapter.loginMiddleware("/home"), (req, res) => {
        // This response will never be sent because the middleware handles the 
        // request directly
    });
});
```

### `protectMiddleware([conditions])`
Middleware to protect Express routes based on authentication and, optionally,
authorization via Keycloak roles.

Allows restricting access to a resource only to authenticated users or
to those possessing specific roles in the realm or in a Keycloak client.

@param {string|function} [conditions]
- If a string, specifies one or more required roles, using the syntax:
    - 'role'              → client role in the configured client (e.g., 'admin')
    - 'clientid:role'     → client role of a specific client (e.g., 'myclient:editor')
    - 'realm:role'        → realm role (e.g., 'realm:superuser')
  - If a function, receives (token, req) and must return true or false synchronously.
    This function enables custom authorization logic.
    - The `token` object passed to the authorization function exposes methods such as:
      - token.hasRole('admin')               // client role in configured client
      - token.hasRole('realm:superuser')     // realm role
      - token.hasRole('my-client:editor')    // client role of a specific client
      - token.hasResourceRole('editor', 'my-client-id') // equivalent to hasRole('my-client:editor')

    The authorization function must be synchronous and return true (allow access) or false (deny access).

@returns {Function} Express middleware to protect the route.

✅ Usage example:
```js

// Authentication only, no role check
app.get('/admin', keycloakAdapter.protectMiddleware(), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Only authenticated users can see this resource.');
});

// Check on client role of configured client (e.g., 'admin')
app.get('/admin', keycloakAdapter.protectMiddleware('admin'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Only users with the admin client role can access.');
});

// Check on role of a specific client (e.g., client 'clientid', role 'admin')
app.get('/admin', keycloakAdapter.protectMiddleware('clientid:admin'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Only users with admin role in client "clientid" can access.');
});

// Check on realm role (e.g., 'superuser' role at realm level)
app.get('/admin', keycloakAdapter.protectMiddleware('realm:superuser'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Only users with realm superuser role can access.');
});

// Custom synchronous authorization function
app.get('/custom', keycloakAdapter.protectMiddleware((token, req) => {
    // Allow only if user has realm role 'editor'
    // and the request has a specific custom header
    return token.hasRealmRole('editor') && req.headers['x-custom-header'] === 'OK';
}), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Access granted by custom authorization function.');
});

```


### `customProtectMiddleware(fn)`
Middleware similar to `protectMiddleware` but with dynamic role checking via a function.

Unlike `protectMiddleware`, which accepts a string expressing the role or a control function
that works on the token, this middleware accepts a function that receives the Express
request and response objects `req` and `res` and must return a string representing the role control string.

This is useful for parametric resources where the role control string must be dynamically generated based on the request,
for example, based on URL parameters or query strings.

Note: this function **does not** access or parse the token, nor performs any checks other than the role,
so it cannot be used for complex logic depending on request properties other than the role
(e.g., client IP, custom headers, etc.).
The function's sole task is to generate the role control string.

--- Parameters ---

@param {function} customFunction - function that receives (req, res) and returns a string
with the role control string to pass to Keycloak.

✅ Usage example:
```js

app.get('/custom/:id', keycloakAdapter.customProtectMiddleware((req) => {
    // Dynamically builds the client role based on URL parameter 'id'
    return `clientRole${req.params.id}`;
}), (req, res) => {
    res.send(`Access granted to users with role 'clientRole${req.params.id}'`);
});
```


### `enforcerMiddleware(conditions, options)`
`enforcerMiddleware` is a middleware to enable permission checks
based on resources and policies defined in Keycloak Authorization Services (UMA 2.0-based).

Unlike `protectMiddleware` and similar, which only verify authentication or roles,
`enforcerMiddleware` allows checking if the user has permission to access
a specific protected resource through flexible and dynamic policies.

Useful in contexts where resources are registered in Keycloak (such as documents, instances, dynamic entities) and
protected by flexible policies.

--- Parameters ---

@param {string|function} conditions
- string containing the name of the resource or permission to check
- custom check function with signature:
  function(token, req, callback)
    - token: decoded Keycloak token
    - req: Express request
    - callback(boolean): invoke with true if authorized, false otherwise

@param {object} [options] (optional)
- response_mode: 'permissions' (default) or 'token'
- claims: object with claim info for dynamic policies (e.g. owner id matching)
- resource_server_id: resource client id (default: current client)

--- How it works ---
- If conditions is a function, it is used for custom checks with callback.
- If conditions is a string, `keycloak.enforcer(conditions, options)` is used for the check.

--- response_mode modes ---
1) 'permissions' (default)
    - Keycloak returns the list of granted permissions (no new token)
    - Permissions available in `req.permissions`

2) 'token'
    - Keycloak issues a new access token containing the granted permissions
    - Permissions available in `req.kauth.grant.access_token.content.authorization.permissions`
    - Useful for apps with sessions and decision caching

--- Keycloak requirements ---

The client must have:
- Authorization Enabled = ON
- Policy Enforcement Mode = Enforcing
- Add permissions to access token = ON

You must also configure in Keycloak:
- Resources
- Policies (e.g., role, owner, JS script)
- Permissions (associate policies to resources)

✅ Usage example:
```js

// Check with static string
app.get('/onlyAdminroute', keycloakAdapter.enforcerMiddleware('ui-admin-resource'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('You are an authorized admin for this resource');
});

// Check with custom function (async with callback)
app.get('/onlyAdminrouteByfunction', keycloakAdapter.enforcerMiddleware(function(token, req, callback) {
    token.hasPermission('ui-admin-resource', function(permission) {
        if (permission) callback(true);
        else {
            token.hasPermission('ui-viewer-resource', function(permission) {
                callback(permission ? true : false);
            });
        }
    });
}), (req, res) => {
    res.send('You are an authorized admin or viewer (custom check)');
});
```

### `customEnforcerMiddleware(fn, options)`
`customEnforcerMiddleware` is a middleware for permission checks based on resources and policies
defined in Keycloak Authorization Services (UMA 2.0), using dynamic permission strings.

This middleware is similar to `enforcerMiddleware`, but takes a function
`customFunction(req, res)` as a parameter, which must dynamically return
the permission/resource string to be checked.

--- Parameters ---

@param {function} customFunction
Function that receives `req` and `res` and returns the control string for Keycloak.
Example:
```js
function customFunction(req, res) {
    // Your function logic
    return req.params.permission;
}
```

@param {object} [options] (optional)
Additional options passed to `keycloak.enforcer()`, including:
    - response_mode: 'permissions' (default) or 'token'
    - claims: object with claim info for dynamic policies (e.g., owner ID)
    - resource_server_id: string representing the resource client ID (default: current client)

--- response_mode options ---
1) 'permissions' (default)
    - The server returns only the list of granted permissions (no new token)
    - Permissions available in `req.permissions`

2) 'token'
    - The server issues a new access token with granted permissions
    - Permissions available in `req.kauth.grant.access_token.content.authorization.permissions`
    - Useful for decision caching, session handling, automatic token refresh

--- Keycloak Requirements ---

The client must be configured with:
- Authorization Enabled = ON
- Policy Enforcement Mode = Enforcing
- Add permissions to access token = ON

You must also have created:
- Resources
- Policies (e.g., role, owner, JS rules)
- Permissions (linking policies to resources)

✅ Usage example:
```js

const tmpFunctionEnforce = function(req, res) {
    return req.params.permission; // dynamic permission from URL parameter
};

app.get('/onlyAdminrouteByfunction/:permission', keycloakAdapter.customEnforcerMiddleware(tmpFunctionEnforce), (req, res) => {
    res.send('You are an authorized user with dynamic permission: ' + req.params.permission);
});

```

### `encodeTokenRole()`
`encodeTokenRole` is a middleware that decodes the Keycloak token and adds it
to the Express request as `req.encodedTokenRole`.

Unlike `protectMiddleware` or `customProtectMiddleware`, this middleware
does NOT perform any role or authentication checks, but simply extracts
and makes the decoded token available within the route handler function.

It is especially useful when you want to perform custom logic based on roles
or other information contained in the token directly in the route handler,
for example showing different content based on role.

--- Contents of `req.encodedTokenRole` ---

Represents the decoded Keycloak token and exposes several useful methods such as:
- token.hasRole('admin')             // true/false if it has client role "admin"
- token.hasRole('realm:superuser')   // true/false if it has realm role "superuser"
- token.hasRole('my-client:editor')  // true/false if it has client role "editor" for client "my-client"
- token.hasResourceRole('editor', 'my-client-id') // identical to hasRole('my-client:editor')

✅ Usage example:
```js

app.get('/encodeToken', keycloakAdapter.encodeTokenRole(), (req, res) => {
    if (req.encodedTokenRole.hasRole('realm:admin')) {
        res.send("User with admin (realm) role in encodeToken");
    } else {
        res.send("Regular user in encodeToken");
    }
});

```

### `encodeTokenPermission()`
`encodeTokenPermission` ia s Middleware whose sole purpose is to decode the access token present in the request
and add to the `req` object a property called `encodedTokenPermission` containing the token's permissions.

Unlike `enforcerMiddleware` and `customEnforcerMiddleware`, it **does not perform any access**
or authorization checks, but exposes a useful method (`hasPermission`) for checking permissions
within the route handler.

It is particularly useful when:
- you want to **customize the response** based on the user's permissions (e.g., show a different page),
- you want to **manually handle access** or perform custom checks on multiple permissions,
- you do not want to block access upfront but decide dynamically within the route handler.

--- Additions to `req` ---

After applying the middleware, `req` contains:
- @property {Object} req.encodedTokenPermission
An object exposing the method:
    - hasPermission(permission: string, callback: function(boolean))
      Checks whether the token contains the specified permission.
      The callback receives `true` if the permission is present, `false` otherwise.

✅ Usage example:
```js

app.get('/encodeTokenPermission',
    keycloakAdapter.encodeTokenPermission(),
    (req, res) => {
        req.encodedTokenPermission.hasPermission('ui-admin-resource', function(perm) {
            if (perm)
                res.send('You are an authorized admin user by function permission parameters');
            else
                res.status(403).send('Access Denied by encodeTokenPermission');
        });
    });

```

### `loginMiddleware(redirectTo)`
`loginMiddleware` is a Middleware used to **force user authentication** via Keycloak.

It is particularly useful when you want to: 
- ensure the user is authenticated,
- redirect the user to a specific page after login or when access is denied,
- integrate automatic login flows on routes that don’t require direct authorization,
    but where login should still be enforced (e.g., profile page, personal area, etc.).

--- Behavior ---
1. If the user is **not authenticated**, Keycloak redirects them to the login flow.
2. If authentication fails or is denied, the user is redirected according to Keycloak's configured settings.
3. If authentication is successful, the user is redirected to 'redirectTo' (usually `/home`, `/dashboard`, etc.).

--- Parameters ---

@param {string} redirectTo - URL to redirect the user to after login.

--- Warning ---

The route handler callback is **never executed**, because the middleware will respond earlier
with a redirect or block the request.

✅ Usage example:
```js

app.get('/loginMiddleware', keycloakAdapter.loginMiddleware("/home"), (req, res) => {
        // This section is never reached
        res.send("If you see this message, something went wrong.");
});

```


### `logoutMiddleware(redirectTo)`
`logoutMiddleware` Middleware is used to **force user logout**, removing the local session
and redirecting the user to Keycloak's logout endpoint according to its configuration.

It is useful when:
- You want to completely log out the user,
- You want to **terminate the session on Keycloak** (not just locally),
- You want to redirect the user to a public page, such as a homepage, after logout.

--- Behavior ---
1. Retrieves the `id_token` of the authenticated user.
2. Constructs the Keycloak logout URL including the token and the redirect URL.
3. **Destroys the local Express session** (e.g., cookies, user data).
4. Redirects the user to the Keycloak logout URL, which in turn redirects to the provided URL.

--- Parameters ---

@param {string} redirectTo - URL to which the user will be redirected after complete logout.

✅ Usage example:
```js

app.get('/logoutMiddleware', keycloakAdapter.logoutMiddleware("http://localhost:3001/home"),  (req, res) => {
        // This section is never reached
        // The middleware handles logout and redirection automatically
    });

```

--- Note ---
- The middleware **never executes the route callback**, as it fully handles the response.
- The `redirectTo` parameter must match a **valid redirect URI** configured in Keycloak for the client.

--- Requirements ---
- The Keycloak client must have properly configured `Valid Redirect URIs`.
- The Express session must be active (e.g., `express-session` properly initialized).


## 🔧 Available Functions

### `login(req, res, redirectTo)`
`login` Function not a middleware, but a **classic synchronous function** that forces user authentication
via Keycloak and, if the user is not authenticated, redirects them to the login page.
After successful login, the user is redirected to the URL specified in the `redirectTo` parameter.

--- Differences from `loginMiddleware` ---
- `loginMiddleware` handles everything automatically **before** the route handler function.
- `login` instead is a function **that can be manually called inside the route handler**,
  offering **greater control** over when and how login is enforced.

--- Parameters ---

- @param {Object} req - Express `Request` object
- @param {Object} res - Express `Response` object
- @param {string} redirectTo - URL to redirect the user to after successful login

--- Behavior ---
1. Attempts to protect the request using `keycloak.protect()`.
2. If the user **is authenticated**, it performs `res.redirect(redirectTo)`.
3. If **not authenticated**, Keycloak automatically handles redirection to the login page.

✅ Usage example:
```js

app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
    // Your route logic
    // ...
    // Force authentication if necessary
    keycloakAdapter.login(req, res, "/home");
});

```

--- Notes ---
- The function can be called **within an Express route**, allowing for custom conditional logic.
- Useful for scenarios where only certain conditions should trigger a login.

--- Requirements ---
- `Valid Redirect URIs` must include the URL passed to `redirectTo`.

### `logout(req, res, redirectTo)`
`logout` Function is not a middleware, but a **classic synchronous function** that forces the user to logout
via Keycloak. In addition to terminating the current session (if any), it generates the Keycloak
logout URL and redirects the user's browser to that address.

--- Differences from `logoutMiddleware` ---
- `logoutMiddleware` is designed to be used directly as middleware in the route definition.
- `logout` instead is a function **to be called inside the route**, useful for handling logout
  **conditionally** or within more complex logic.

--- Parameters ---
- @param {Object} req - Express `Request` object
- @param {Object} res - Express `Response` object
- @param {string} redirectTo - URL to redirect the user after logout

--- Behavior ---
1. Retrieves the `id_token` from the current user's Keycloak token (if present).
2. Builds the logout URL using `keycloak.logoutUrl()`.
3. Destroys the user's Express session.
4. Redirects the user to the Keycloak logout URL, which in turn redirects to `redirectTo`.

✅ Usage example:
```js

app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
    // Any custom logic before logout
    // ...
    keycloakAdapter.logout(req, res, "http://localhost:3001/home");
});

```

--- Requirements ---
- The user must be authenticated with Keycloak and have a valid token in `req.kauth.grant`.
- The URL specified in `redirectTo` must be present in the `Valid Redirect URIs` in the Keycloak client.

---


## 🔧 Admin Functions
All administrative functions that rely on Keycloak's Admin API must be invoked using the 
keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.{entity}.{function} pattern. 
 - {entyty} represents the type of resource you want to manage (e.g., users, roles, groups, clients).
 - {function} is the specific operation you want to perform on that resource (e.g., find, create, update, del).
For example:
```js
// get all users of this client
// users is the entity you want to administer.
// find is the method used to retrieve the list of users.
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.users.find();
 ```
Credits to @keycloak/keycloak-admin-client. 
This admin function is built on top of it. For more details, please refer to the official repository.

### `entity realm`

    clientUniqueId:'internal-client-id',
});
console.log('Assigned client roles:', availableRoles);
```


##### `function listCompositeClientRoleMappings(filters)`
Retrieves the list of composite client roles assigned to a specific group. 
Composite roles are roles that aggregate other roles, so this method returns client roles that include one or more roles grouped under a composite role assigned to the group.
@parameters:
- filters: parameter provided as a JSON object that accepts the following parameters:
  - id: [required] The ID of the group
  - clientUniqueId: [required] The internal ID of the client

```js
 // list composite client role-mappings for group
const compositeClientRoles= await keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.groups.listCompositeClientRoleMappings({
    id: 'gropd-id',
    clientUniqueId:'internal-client-id',
});
console.log('Composite client roles assigned to group:', compositeClientRoles);
```


##### `function delClientRoleMappings(filters)`
Removes specific client role mappings from a group. 
This function deletes one or more client roles that were assigned to the group, effectively revoking those client roles from the group.
@parameters:
- filters: parameter provided as a JSON object that accepts the following parameters:
  - id: [required] The ID of the group
  - clientUniqueId: [required] The internal ID of the client
  - roles: An array of role objects(RoleRepresentation) representing the client roles to be removed

```js
 // delete the created role
await keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.groups.delClientRoleMappings({
    id: 'gropd-id',
    clientUniqueId:'internal-client-id',
    roles: [
        {
            id: 'role-id',
            name: 'role-name'
    }]
});
```






### `entity roles`
The roles entity refers to Keycloak's roles management functionality, part of the Admin REST API. 
It allows you to create, update, inspect, and delete both realm-level and client-level roles.

#### `entity roles functions`
##### `function create(role_dictionary)`
Create a new role
```js
 // create a role name called my-role
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.create({name:'my-role'});
 ```
##### `function createComposite(params: { roleId: string }, payload: RoleRepresentation[]`
Create a new composite role
Composite roles in Keycloak are roles that combine other roles, allowing you to group multiple permissions 
into a single, higher-level role. A composite role can include roles from the same realm as well
as roles from different clients. When you assign a composite role to a user, 
they automatically inherit all the roles it contains.


```js
 // create a  composite role where "admin" include anche "reader".
const adminRole = await client.roles.findOneByName({ name: 'admin' });
const readerRole = await client.roles.findOneByName({ name: 'reader' });

await client.roles.createComposite({ roleId: adminRole.id }, [readerRole]);
 ```

##### `function find()`
get all realm roles and return a JSON
```js
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.find();
 ```
##### `function findOneByName(filter)`
get a role by name
```js
 // get information about 'my-role' role
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.findOneByName({ name: 'my-role' });
 ```

##### `function findOneById(filter)`
get a role by its Id
```js
 // get information about 'my-role-id' role
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.findOneById({ id: 'my-role-id' });
 ```

##### `function updateByName(filter,role_dictionary)`
update a role by its name
```js
 // update 'my-role' role with a new description
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.updateByName({ name: 'my-role' }, {description:"new Description"});
 ```

##### `function updateById(filter,role_dictionary)`
update a role by its id
```js
 // update role by id 'my-role-id' with a new description
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.updateById({ id: 'my-role-id' }, {description:"new Description"});
 ```

##### `function delByName(filter)`
delete a role by its name
```js
 // delete role  'my-role' 
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.delByName({ name: 'my-role' });
 ```

##### `function findUsersWithRole(filter)`
Find all users associated with a specific role.
```js
 // Find all users associated with role named 'my-role' 
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.findUsersWithRole({ name: 'my-role' });
 ```

##### `function getCompositeRoles({id:roleid})`
Find all composite roles associated with a specific id.
```js
 // Find all composite role named 'my-role' and id 'my-role-id' 
 keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.getCompositeRoles({ id: 'my-role-id' });
 ```

##### `function getCompositeRolesForRealm({roleId:roleid})`
The getCompositeRolesForRealm function  is used to 
retrieve all realm-level roles that are associated with a given composite role. 
When a role is defined as composite, it can include other roles either from the same 
realm or from different clients. This specific method returns only the realm-level roles
that have been added to the composite role. It requires the roleId of the target role as a 
parameter and returns an array of RoleRepresentation objects. If the role is not composite
or has no associated realm roles, the result will be an empty array. This method is useful 
for understanding and managing hierarchical role structures within a realm in Keycloak.
```js
const compositeRoles = await keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.getCompositeRolesForRealm({ roleId: 'role-id' });
console.log('admin composite roles:', compositeRoles.map(r => r.name));
 
 ```

##### `function getCompositeRolesForClient({roleId:'roleid', clientId:'clientId'})`
The getCompositeRolesForClient function is used to retrieve 
all client-level roles that are associated with a given composite role. 
Composite roles in Keycloak can include roles from different clients,
and this method specifically returns the roles belonging to a specified client that
are part of the composite role. It requires the roleId of the composite role 
and the clientId of the client whose roles you want to retrieve. The function returns an array of
RoleRepresentation objects representing the client roles included in the composite. 
This helps manage and inspect client-specific role hierarchies within the composite role structure in Keycloak.
```js
const compositeRoles = await keycloakAdapter.kcAdminClient.roles.getCompositeRolesForClient({
    roleId: 'compositeRole-Id',
    clientId: 'client-Id'
});
console.log('admin composite roles fo client whith Id:clientId:', compositeRoles.map(r => r.name));
 
 ```




### `entity components`

    { flow: "browser" },
    {
        id: "exec1-abc",
        requirement: "ALTERNATIVE",
        priority: 10,
    }
);

console.log("Execution updated successfully");

 ```


##### `function delExecution(filter)`
The method deletes an existing execution (step) from an authentication flow in a Keycloak realm.
Executions are individual authenticators or subflows within a flow, and this method removes them completely from the flow.
